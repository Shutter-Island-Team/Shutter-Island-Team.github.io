            <h2>Map generation</h2>
            <h3>Geometry</h3>
            <p>
	     The first step is to divide the map into homongeneous areas.  	
            </p>
            <p>
	      To make the division look not too obvious at the first
                  glance, a good way is to built a Voronoi diagram. If
                  we correctly choose the seeds of the diagram (like
                  in the project with controlled Gaussian draws), the
                  division pattern will not be too visible.
            </p>

            <p class="text-center"><em>Example of Voronoi Diagram we
            can create</em></p>

            <h3>Geography</h3>
            <p>
	      Once the geometry of the map has been computed, the next
                step is to assign to each cell a climate area -
                referred to the name of <i> Biome </i> in the following.
            </p>
            <p>
	      However, the outcoming map must look coherent. To do so,
                we define some basic rules for the assignation that
                should result in a map that looks plausible. The rules
                used are approximately the followings :
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
	       The cells that are on the edge of the map are
                    necessarily of type <i>Sea</i>, as we are supposed
                    to be on an island.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The center of the map is very likely to be of
                    type <i> Land </i>, with a decreasing probability
                    as we get closer to the edges.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <i> Land </i> neighbouring the <i>Sea</i> gets
                    the subtype <i>Sand</i>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A <i> Land </i> can turn into a <i>Mountain</i> or
                    a <i>Lake</i>.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The previous Voronoi diagram can, with these rules,
                turn into the following map. The legend is :
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Dark blue: Sea
                </li>
                <li>
                    Yellow: Sand
                </li>
                <li>
                    Green: Lands
                </li>
                <li>
                    Light blue: Lake
                </li>
                <li>
                    Red: Mountain
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Height Map</h3>
            <p>
	   For the map rendering, we cannot, like in other methods,
                create the height map using a coherent noise (like the
                Simplex Noise). Indeed, these approach start by
                computing a height map using the noise, and THEN using
                some topological rules, compute the biome map. This
                quite the opposite of the approach we have here, which
                is to start from a biome map (procedurally computed or
                drawn by an artist).
            </p>
            <p>
	   However, we can try to adapt the coherent noise generation
                algorithm to generate our own noise that will be
                controlled using the information of the biome map. <i>The
                understanding of the rest of this part requires the
                reader to be familiar with the Perlin noise</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
	     During the construction of each octaves, we are going to
                control a lot of informations. First we are going to
                control the range of the noise values that are going
                to be drawn. For example, a draw that happens on a sea
                will be drawn in a negative range, while a draw that
                happens on lands will be drawn in a range of small
                positive values. Then, the interpolation function will
                not be the same on the whole grid like in the Perlin
                noise, but will depend on the biomes to take into
                account their geometry and their extent. For istance,
                a mountain will have a limited are, and should have
                sharp edges whereas lands can expand on large areas
                and will be smooth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Octave 1:
            </p>
            <img src="ressources/images/Shutter_Island_Heighttree1.png" class="img-responsive center-block">
            <p class="text-center"><em>Octave 1</em></p>
            <p>
                Octave 2:
            </p>
            <img src="ressources/images/Shutter_Island_Heighttree2.png" class="img-responsive center-block">
            <p class="text-center"><em>Octave 2</em></p>
            <p>
                ...
            </p>
            <p>
                The outcoming noise is thus coherent with the biome
                map. The results of this step can ben view in the
                following section.

            <h2>Terrain rendering</h2>
            <h3>Basic rendering</h3>
            <p>
	      This first version of the island simply corresponds to
                the application of the height map on the Voronoi diagram.
            </p>
            <p>
               The orange plane represents the sea level.
            </p>

            <p class="text-center"><em>Basic rendering</em></p>

            <h3>Tessellation and Levels of Details</h3>
            <p>
	      The <i>Tessellation</i> process simply consists in
                transforming an object into a mesh that is composed of
                polygons. Re-tessellating a mesh by increasing the
                number of polygons (triangles here) can improve the
              rendering quality.
            </p>
            <p>
	    In <i>OpenGL4</i>, the <i>Tessellation Shaders</i> provide
                a quite 'simple' control on the tessellation
                level. Thanks to these shaders, we can decide for each
                basic triangle in how many sub-triangles it will be
                divided for the rendering.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is a short animation showing how increasing the
                tessellation can affect the quality of the rendering.
            </p>
            <img src="ressources/images/600px-Shutter_Island_Tessellation_Factor.gif" class="img-responsive center-block">
            <p class="text-center"><em>Map rendering at different
            tessellation levels</em></p>

            <p>
	      However, it is quite obvious that the tessellation level
	      is not a constant on the whole scene. For example, take
	      a look at the rabbit below. The ultra-tessellated
	      version on the left is perfect for a close-up, but is
	      horribly expensive and useless if the rabbit is far from
	      the camera. In this last case, we should better use the
	      ultra-low polygon version on the right.
            </p>
            <img src="ressources/images/600px-Shutter_Island_LoD.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block">
            <p class="text-center"><em>Rabbit mesh with different
            tessellation levels</em></p>

            <p>
                The idea is - still in the tessellation shader - to
                compute for each triangle the <i>Level of Detail</i>
                it needs to be represented. This value may depend on
                the geometry of the triangle (equilateral or thin),
                its size, its distance to the camera etc. The higher
                this level of detail is, the more the triangle will be
                tessellated. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We can see in the animation below that the edges of
                the lake we are zooming on are progressively becoming
                smoother.
            </p>
            <img src="ressources/images/600px-Shutter_Island_Tessellation.gif" class="img-responsive center-block">
            <p class="text-center"><em>Map rendering with different
            levels of detail</em></p>

            <h3>Texturization</h3>
            <p>
	    Even if the resolution has been increased by the
                tessellation process, the borders of the biomes are
                still defined by the edges of the Voronoi cells.
            </p>
            <p>
	   In the rendering, we have to hide these straight lines. To
                do so, we simply blend the texture on these edges to
                get smooth transitions from one biome to another.
            </p>
            <p>
	      This is done through a texture map. This map will store
                for a set of sampled positions the proportions of each
                texture at the position.
            </p>

            <p class="text-center"><em>Example of texture blending</em></p>

            <h3>Water rendering</h3>
            <p>As we are on a island with lakes inside, we also have
            to render the water planes.</p>

            <h4>Sea rendering</h4>
            <p>
	    The sea is simply defined by a textured plane at the
                alitude 0.
            </p>
            <h4>Lake Rendering</h4>
            <p>
	      Rendering lakes is a bit more tricky as we have to
                compute connected lake components. This then enable us
                to compute the altitude of the lake and render a
                proper water plane.
            </p>

            <p class="text-center"><em>Sea rendering</em></p>

            <h3>Final rendering</h3>
            <p>
	      To finish this not-so-bad rendering, we simply have to
                add a skybox around our island, which can lead to
                results as the following picture.
